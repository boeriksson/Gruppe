#Backend Cygnos - a starter plate

This is a simple backend that exposed a couple of REST endpoints for searching tracks and playing, pausing and stopping a track. It is also possible to query the current state and volume as well as setting the volume.

##Prerequisites

1. Java 8 with Java FX (OpenJDK won't work)
2. curl for running the examples below

##Running
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

##Web page
There is a simple web page that illustrates the search and playing of tracks here:

http://localhost:8080/index.html
